# Ward 6

See **GameplayScreenshots** for a look into what the game looks like!

**Ward 6** is a psychological horror experience built with **Unity and C#**, inspired by Exit 8, where players must carefully observe their environment and detect anomalies to progress through increasingly tough scenes to exit the pysch ward.

I uniquely worked on the core game systems and coding architecture, including the scene management, progress tracking through the clock's mechanics, and anomaly spawning algorithms.

## Features
- Exit 8-inspired anomaly detection gameplay — spot the differences and walk through the south hallway or walk through the north hallway
- Progressive difficulty system — anomaly spawn rates change as you advance  
- Dynamic clock visualization that tracks your progress
- Teleportation mechanics for seamless gameplay flow
- Shuffle bag anomaly system ensuring variety without immediate repeats
- Medical ward theming with patient recovery narrative

## Built With
- Unity  
- C#  

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the project in Unity  
3. Press **Play** in the Unity Editor to begin your recovery  
4. **Walk forward** if the scene appears normal, **walk backward** if you spot an anomaly
5. Make correct choices to advance the clock — wrong choices reset you to midnight!
